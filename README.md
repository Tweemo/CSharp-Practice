** Practice Exercise for learning C#
* Handy things to know:
    - Console.WriteLine will print text to the console, can be used similarly to Console.log in js.
    - Console.ReadLine will be our way to save user input to a variable. 
    - Strings in C# unlike javascript can only exist in double quotes ("").
    - If you are using Visual Studio there is a play button to run the program, otherwise if you are using Visual Studio Code, use `dotnet run` in the terminal to run the program.
